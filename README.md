# Mission Control Language (MCL)

**Expert** = reusable intelligence  
**Mission** = codified thinking model  
**Agent**   = endpoint / runtime facade

That is the architecture. Everything else follows from it.

---

## What MCL is

MCL is a language for codifying thinking models.

Not a workflow engine. Not a prompt template system. Not an agent framework.

Most AI tooling focuses on *what* to ask. MCL focuses on *how to think* — and keeps that separate from *who does the thinking*.

Experts supply the intelligence. Missions supply the thinking model that directs it. These are separate, composable concerns — and that separation is what makes complex reasoning reproducible.

---

## The three concepts

### Expert

An Expert is a reusable intelligence package.

Experts encapsulate knowledge, methodology, review criteria, and domain expertise. They are designed to be portable and distributable — first-class artifacts, not inline prompt strings.

```fsharp
expert KubernetesArchitect =
    from "ghcr.io/katasec/forge-kubernetes-architect"
    version "0.1.0"
```

Experts can be composed from other experts:

```fsharp
expert KubernetesArchitect =
    RequirementsAnalyst
    |> PlatformArchitect
    |> ReliabilityArchitect
```

An Expert answers: **Who performs this work?**

---

### Mission

A Mission is a codified thinking model.

A mission makes explicit *how* a problem should be reasoned through — which experts engage, in what order, and how their outputs build on each other. It is the structure of thought, written down.

```fsharp
mission BuildOperatorDesign(goal, persona) =
    KubernetesArchitect
    |> SecurityArchitect
    |> PrincipalReviewer with { style = "terse ADR" }
```

The mental model is a chain of expertise, not a call stack:

```
KubernetesArchitect   ← drafts the design
        ↓
SecurityArchitect     ← hardens it
        ↓
PrincipalReviewer     ← signs off
```

Each stage receives the accumulated context and all prior outputs, then applies its domain expertise before passing forward.

Missions are reusable. The same thinking model can be applied to different goals, by different experts, in different contexts.

A Mission answers: **How should this problem be thought through?**

---

### Agent

An Agent is a runtime endpoint.

An agent exposes one or more missions behind a conversational interface — VS Code, Open WebUI, Claude Code, or any OpenAI-compatible client.

```fsharp
agent BuildOperator =
    uses BuildOperatorDesign
```

The user talks to the agent. The agent runs the mission. The mission coordinates the experts.

An Agent answers: **How does a user consume this capability?**

---

## OCI-distributed experts

OCI distributes expertise. Missions codify how that expertise is applied.

These are deliberately separate concerns. An expert is packaged intelligence — versioned, addressable, and shareable across projects and teams. A mission is the thinking model that decides which experts engage and how their outputs build on each other. You can swap the experts without changing the thinking model, and evolve the thinking model without touching the experts.

MCL uses OCI (Open Container Initiative) registries as the distribution mechanism for expertise. The same infrastructure that distributes container images and Helm charts now distributes domain intelligence:

```fsharp
expert SecurityArchitect =
    from "ghcr.io/katasec/forge-security-architect"
    version "0.1.0"
```

`forge init` resolves expert references and caches them in `~/.forge/experts/`. The `mcl.lock` file records exactly what was resolved, mirroring Terraform's plan/apply discipline.

```bash
forge init                        # pull experts from OCI, generate mcl.lock
forge run                         # run with resolved experts
forge clean                       # purge the local cache
forge clean --registry ghcr.io    # purge one registry
forge login ghcr.io --token <pat> # authenticate to a private registry
```

This turns expertise into a supply chain — versioned, auditable, and independently evolved.

---

## The language boundary

MCL is intentionally not a general-purpose programming language.

The language expresses reasoning, not computation. `|>` is an expertise flow operator. There are no loops over data, no branching on values, no string manipulation.

**Right direction:**

```fsharp
Architect |> Reviewer |> Judge
```

**Wrong direction:**

```fsharp
for  while  if  match  map  filter
```

When a mission needs to retry until quality passes, that is a reasoning pattern — expressed as a loop cap on the mission, not imperative control flow:

```fsharp
mission RefinedPitch(product) =
    PitchDrafter
    |> PitchCritic
    |> PitchJudge
    loop 3
```

The language has one job: express how expertise is applied to a problem.

---

## Mission Control

MCL is the language. Mission Control is the operating environment around it.

Thinking models only work if the context they operate on stays coherent. Mission Control addresses a deeper problem: **context entropy** — the degradation of LLM effectiveness as monolithic context accumulates over long-running work.

Mission Control's answer is hub/spoke knowledge organisation:

```
plan.md   ←  hub (index of intent and decisions)
    ├── phase-11.md
    ├── phase-12.md
    └── architecture.md
```

The plan acts as an index. Individual tasks and decisions live in focused spoke documents. This keeps context targeted and reasoning precise — regardless of how much work has accumulated.

Longer term, Mission Control introduces the Session Continuity Protocol (SCP) — a protocol for maintaining plans, decisions, and context across sessions without blowup. The hub/spoke pattern is already in use throughout this project.

---

## Quick start

```bash
export MCL_API_KEY=sk-...

forge init    # resolve experts, generate mcl.lock
forge run     # run the mission, output to stdout
```

---

## Running an agent

An agent exposes a mission as an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. It runs in Docker using a pre-built `ghcr.io/katasec/forge` image — no local build step.

Create an `agent.yaml` next to your mission:

```yaml
mission: ../../missions/loop-demo/mission.mcl
port: 8080
id: loop-demo-v1
```

Then start it:

```bash
forge agent start --agent-file agents/loop-demo/agent.yaml
```

The agent mounts your repository root into the container so relative expert and mission paths resolve correctly. `MCL_API_KEY`, `MCL_MODEL`, `MCL_PROVIDER`, and `MCL_ENDPOINT` are forwarded from the host environment automatically.

Stop it with:

```bash
forge agent stop --agent-file agents/loop-demo/agent.yaml
```

---

## Open WebUI

`forge webui start` spins up [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) connected to the running agent. Both containers join a shared `forge-net` Docker bridge network for inter-container DNS.

```bash
forge webui start --agent-file agents/loop-demo/agent.yaml
# → http://localhost:3000
```

The agent appears in the model selector under its declared `id`. Stop with:

```bash
forge webui stop
```

> **Note:** the agent URL is stored in Open WebUI's internal database. If you switch to a different agent, run `forge webui stop` first — the next `forge webui start` will pick up the new agent.

---

## Writing a mission

A mission file is self-contained and encodes exactly one mission. It declares where experts come from, binds input values, and describes the reasoning pattern. (A file may include multiple `expert` declarations alongside the single `mission` — that is expected. Only the number of `mission` declarations is constrained to one.)

```fsharp
// Provider
let provider = env("MCL_PROVIDER", "openai")
let apiKey   = env("MCL_API_KEY")
let model    = env("MCL_MODEL", "gpt-4o-mini")

// Inputs
let goal    = "Design a production-grade K8s build operator"
let persona = "Principal SRE, Tekton specialist"

// Experts — pulled from OCI on forge init
expert KubernetesArchitect =
    from "ghcr.io/katasec/forge-kubernetes-architect"
    version "0.1.0"

expert SecurityArchitect =
    from "ghcr.io/katasec/forge-security-architect"
    version "0.1.0"

expert PrincipalReviewer =
    from "ghcr.io/katasec/forge-principal-reviewer"
    version "0.1.0"

// Thinking model
mission BuildOperatorDesign(goal, persona) =
    KubernetesArchitect
    |> SecurityArchitect
    |> PrincipalReviewer with { style = "terse ADR" }
```

---

## Writing an expert

Each expert is a markdown file with a YAML frontmatter header and a system prompt.
`{{key}}` placeholders are interpolated from the context bag before the step runs.

```markdown
---
name: KubernetesArchitect
input: Task description
output: Kubernetes architecture design
---

You are a senior Kubernetes architect.

Goal: {{goal}}
Perspective: {{persona}}

Produce a concrete architecture covering CRD design, controller structure,
RBAC, and operational concerns.
```

Scaffold a new expert:

```bash
forge expert init SecurityArchitect
```

Local experts live alongside the mission file. OCI experts are cached globally under
`~/.forge/experts/` and shared across all projects.

```
missions/build-operator/
  mission.mcl
  mcl.lock
  experts/
    SecurityArchitect/
      expert.md
```

---

## CLI

```bash
forge init                                     # resolve experts, write mcl.lock
forge validate                                 # lint the mission file (syntax only)
forge run                                      # run the mission
forge run --steps                              # stream each expert's output live
forge run --var goal="Redesign for ARM64"      # override a let binding at runtime
forge clean                                    # purge ~/.forge/experts
forge clean --registry ghcr.io                # purge one registry
forge login ghcr.io --token <pat>             # save registry credentials
forge expert init SecurityArchitect           # scaffold a new expert
forge list experts                            # list local experts

forge agent start --agent-file <path>         # start agent container (Docker)
forge agent stop  --agent-file <path>         # stop and remove agent container
forge webui start --agent-file <path>         # start Open WebUI connected to agent
forge webui stop                              # stop and remove Open WebUI container
```

`forge run` requires an `mcl.lock` — `forge init` is not optional.

---

## Variables

`let` bindings seed the context bag. Every expert in the pipeline can read any binding
via `{{key}}` in its system prompt.

```fsharp
let goal   = "Design a build operator"
let apiKey = env("MCL_API_KEY")
let model  = env("MCL_MODEL", "gpt-4o-mini")
```

### Provider configuration

Four bindings are reserved for LLM provider configuration:

```fsharp
let provider = env("MCL_PROVIDER", "openai")     // openai (azure and others planned)
let apiKey   = env("MCL_API_KEY")                // required — no default
let model    = env("MCL_MODEL", "gpt-4o-mini")
let endpoint = env("MCL_ENDPOINT", "")           // required for Azure
```

`with` overrides context for a single step only:

```fsharp
|> PrincipalReviewer with { style = "terse ADR", audience = "C-suite" }
```

Variable resolution order (lowest → highest precedence):

1. `let` binding
2. `with { }` clause on the step
3. `--var key=value` CLI flag

---

## Pass / fail

Every step passes by default — like a shell command exiting with code 0.
A step signals failure by returning a structured fail status in its output.

If any step fails, the pipeline stops immediately. Expert authors declare failure
conditions in plain prose — the runtime handles the structured contract:

```markdown
You are the final judge. If the pitch is unclear, too long, or contains jargon —
declare failure and state which criterion was missed.
```

---

## Looping until quality passes

```fsharp
mission RefinedPitch(product) =
    PitchDrafter
    |> PitchCritic
    |> PitchReviser
    |> PitchJudge
    loop 3
```

The runtime retries the full pipeline on failure, up to the declared limit. Two reserved
variables are available to every expert in every attempt:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{{attempt}}` | Current attempt number, 1-based. |
| `{{max_loops}}` | Declared loop cap. |

Experts can use these to adjust behaviour across retries:

```markdown
This is attempt {{attempt}} of {{max_loops}}.
If this is the final attempt, be especially strict — there are no more chances to improve.
```

---

## Reserved context variables

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{{output}}` | The previous step's text output. Empty string on the first step. |
| `{{attempt}}` | Current loop iteration, 1-based. Always `1` for missions without `loop`. |
| `{{max_loops}}` | Declared loop cap. Always `1` for missions without `loop`. |

---

## Output routing

By default the mission result goes to stdout — pipeable like any CLI tool:

```bash
forge run                        # stdout
forge run > report.md            # redirect
forge run | pbcopy               # pipe
```

Declare the destination in the mission file to make it explicit:

```fsharp
output(BuildOperatorDesign)                 # stdout (default)
output(BuildOperatorDesign, "./report.md")  # write to file
```

Status messages always go to stderr and never pollute the output stream.
