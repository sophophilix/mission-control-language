# Phase 22b — ONNX Expert Kind

> **Status: Todo**  
> **Depends on:** Phase 22a (kind dispatch, HttpExpertRunner) — Done  
> **Blocks:** UC-3 (Log Anomaly Detection) demo mission  
> **Context:** This is the second half of Phase 22. Phase 22a shipped `kind: http` and
> the kind dispatch infrastructure. Phase 22b completes the non-LLM expert story by
> adding `kind: onnx` for in-process ML model inference.

## Why this matters — the use cases

Three customer use cases motivate non-LLM expert stages. All three were recorded before
this phase was planned, and all three require ML model inference at some step in the pipeline:

**UC-1: Image Analysis Pipeline** — FaceRecogniser, TextExtractor, ObjectClassifier are
classical ML/vision models. They could be `kind: http` (calling an external vision API)
but the canonical form has them as embedded ONNX models running in-process.

**UC-2: Trading Signal Aggregator** — MarketContext, StockContext, SectorContext could
be LLM experts (GPT reading market narrative), but the production use case has scoring
models running against numeric feature vectors. ONNX handles that.

**UC-3: Log Anomaly Detection** — AnomalyDetector is explicitly an ONNX isolation-forest
model in the design spec. It reads named float features (`cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`,
`request_latency`) from the context bag and emits an anomaly score. This is the hardest
dependency — `kind: http` could stand in if the model is deployed as a microservice, but
the intent is always in-process.

## Design

### Expert frontmatter

New fields added to `ExpertFrontmatter` and `ExpertDefinition`:

```markdown
---
name: AnomalyDetector
input: Normalised metric features
output: Anomaly score and pass/fail decision
kind: onnx
model: ./models/isolation-forest.onnx
inputs: cpu_usage, memory_usage, request_latency
outputKey: anomaly_score
threshold: 0.85
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `model` | Yes (kind:onnx) | Path to the `.onnx` file, relative to the expert's directory |
| `inputs` | Yes | Comma-separated list of context bag keys to read as float features |
| `outputKey` | Yes | Context bag key to write the inference score into |
| `threshold` | Yes | Score above this → `status: fail`. At or below → `status: pass` |

Validation in `ExpertLoader.ParseFile`: if `kind == "onnx"`, require `model`, `inputs`,
`outputKey`, `threshold`. Throw `ExpertLoadException` with a clear message if any are missing.

### Context bag typing

Currently `Dictionary<string, object>` holds string values exclusively. ONNX features are
floats. The change: allow `double` to be stored alongside strings. No breaking change:

- LLM prompt interpolation (`{{key}}`) calls `.ToString()` — doubles format correctly
- `kind: rule` evaluators already work on the string `.ToString()` of the output
- ONNX runner reads `double` directly; throws `RuleEvaluationException` (or a new
  `OnnxFeatureException`) if a key is missing or not numeric

Decision: keep the bag as `Dictionary<string, object>`. Typed values are stored as `double`.
A typed context bag (with schema) is under discussion but deferred — the loose bag is
sufficient for these use cases.

### OnnxExpertRunner

```csharp
public class OnnxExpertRunner : IExpertRunner
{
    public Task<StepEnvelope> RunAsync(
        ExpertDefinition expert,
        Dictionary<string, object> context,
        CancellationToken ct = default)
    {
        // 1. Load InferenceSession from expert.Model path
        // 2. Extract float features from context by expert.Inputs keys
        // 3. Run inference → score (float/double)
        // 4. Write score to context[expert.OutputKey]
        // 5. Compare score to expert.Threshold
        // 6. Return StepEnvelope(score.ToString(), score > threshold ? "fail" : "pass")
    }
}
```

`InferenceSession` is created per-call (or cached — TBD based on AOT constraints).
For the initial implementation: create per-call, measure perf, cache if needed.

### Kind dispatch

Add `"onnx"` to the switch in both `ExecuteStepAsync` and `ExecuteParallelStepAsync`
in `PipelineRunner.cs`:

```csharp
var runner = expert.Kind switch
{
    "http" => (IExpertRunner)new HttpExpertRunner(),
    "rule" => new RuleExpertRunner(),
    "onnx" => new OnnxExpertRunner(),
    _      => ResolveRunner(step.Using)
};
```

## AOT considerations — critical gate

This is the primary risk of the phase. OnnxRuntime 1.27.0 was inspected:

- Ships native libraries for all three target platforms: `osx-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `win-arm64` ✓
- Managed bindings (`Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed`) are P/Invoke-based — not reflection-heavy
- No `System.Reflection.Emit` in the managed API surface
- IL3050 suppression is already configured in `Cli.csproj`

**Unresolved: single binary constraint.**

The current `forge` binary is self-contained. OnnxRuntime's native library
(`libonnxruntime.dylib`, `libonnxruntime.so`, `onnxruntime.dll`) cannot be statically
linked — it must deploy alongside the binary. This breaks the single-binary model.

Three options — decision needed before Spoke 3:

| Option | Trade-off |
|--------|-----------|
| A — Deploy alongside | `forge` binary + `libonnxruntime` in same dir. Zip in release. Simplest. |
| B — Optional / plugin | ONNX only available if `libonnxruntime` is present at runtime; graceful error otherwise |
| C — Separate `forge-onnx` binary | AOT-published variant that includes OnnxRuntime. Two release artifacts per platform. |

**Recommended: Option A** — ship as a zip archive per platform for ONNX-enabled releases.
The non-ONNX binary remains a single file for users who don't need it.

**AOT probe is Spoke 1** — must complete before any other spoke is scheduled.

---

## Package placement

`Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` referenced in `ForgeMission.Core.csproj` (so Core owns the
runner, consistent with `HttpExpertRunner` and `RuleExpertRunner`). The native library
lands in the publish output automatically via the package's `runtimes/` folder.

---

## Hub + Spokes

### Spoke 1 — AOT Compatibility Probe (gate)

Add `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` to `ForgeMission.Core.csproj`. Write a minimal
`OnnxExpertRunner` stub that creates an `InferenceSession`. Run `make install`
(native AOT publish). Document all ILC warnings. Add `[DynamicDependency]` or
suppressions as needed. If probe fails badly, evaluate Option C above.

**Output:** AOT probe findings documented in this file. Go/no-go decision recorded.
Only proceed to Spoke 2+ if probe passes or has an acceptable mitigation.

### Spoke 2 — Typed Context Bag

Allow `double` values in `Dictionary<string, object>`. Update `ContextBuilder` to
handle numeric coercion. Update `{{key}}` interpolation in `DirectExpertRunner` to
call `.ToString()` on non-string values. No grammar change.

**Tests:** context bag stores double, LLM interpolation formats correctly, missing
key throws a clear error.

### Spoke 3 — Expert Frontmatter Extension

Add `model`, `inputs`, `outputKey`, `threshold` to `ExpertFrontmatter` (private POCO
in `ExpertLoader`) and `ExpertDefinition` (public record). Add `[DynamicDependency]`
preservation for the new POCO fields (YamlDotNet uses reflection).

Validation in `ExpertLoader.ParseFile`:
- `kind: onnx` + missing `model` → `ExpertLoadException`
- `kind: onnx` + missing `inputs` → `ExpertLoadException`
- `kind: onnx` + missing `outputKey` → `ExpertLoadException`
- `kind: onnx` + missing `threshold` → `ExpertLoadException`

**Tests:** 4 validation tests (one per missing field), 1 happy-path parse test.

### Spoke 4 — OnnxExpertRunner

Implement `OnnxExpertRunner : IExpertRunner`. Steps:
1. Parse `expert.Inputs` (comma-separated) into `string[]` feature keys
2. Read each key from `context` as `double` (throw if missing or not numeric)
3. Build `OrtValue` tensor from feature array
4. Create `InferenceSession` from `expert.Model` path
5. Run `session.Run(inputs)` → extract output value as `double`
6. Write to `context[expert.OutputKey]`
7. Compare to `double.Parse(expert.Threshold)` → pass/fail

Add `"onnx"` to `PipelineRunner` kind dispatch (both sequential and parallel).

**Tests:** mock ONNX model (or a 1-input linear model generated in the test setup),
verify score written to context, verify pass/fail threshold logic.

### Spoke 5 — Single Binary Decision + Release Update

Based on Spoke 1 findings, implement the chosen option (A/B/C). Update the GitHub
Actions release workflow to bundle `libonnxruntime` alongside `forge` if Option A.
Update README and `docs/design/language.md` to document `kind: onnx`.

---

## Dependencies

- Phase 22a (kind dispatch, `ExpertDefinition.Kind`, `ExpertLoader` validation) — Done
- Phase 21 (named outputs, `{{AnomalyDetector.output}}`) — Done
- No grammar changes — `kind: onnx` is a frontmatter field like `kind: http`

---

## Open questions

1. **Single binary constraint** — resolved by Spoke 1 probe findings (see above)
2. **InferenceSession caching** — per-call creation is simple; cache by model path if
   perf is a concern (deferred until measured)
3. **Model path resolution** — relative to expert.md directory or to CWD? Recommend
   relative to expert.md (consistent with OCI pull behaviour)
4. **Float vs double** — ONNX tensors are float32. Context bag stores double. Cast at
   the runner boundary; document the precision loss is expected.
