# FML — Implementation Plan

## Phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Phase 1 — Project Scaffold](phases/phase-1-scaffold.md) | Solution structure, projects, package references | Done |
| [Phase 2 — Parser](phases/phase-2-parser.md) | Lexer, token stream, recursive-descent parser, AST | Done |
| [Phase 3 — Expert Loader](phases/phase-3-expert-loader.md) | Resolve expert names to markdown, parse frontmatter, validate | Done |
| [Phase 4 — Pipeline Runner](phases/phase-4-pipeline-runner.md) | Orchestration loop, IExpertRunner interface, output writer | Done |
| [Phase 5 — MAF Adapter](phases/phase-5-maf-adapter.md) | Implement IExpertRunner using Microsoft Agent Framework | Done |
| [Phase 6 — CLI](phases/phase-6-cli.md) | fml run, fml validate, fml list experts | Done |
| [Phase 7 — Validation](phases/phase-7-validation.md) | Build build-operator example, test hypothesis, document findings | Done |
| [Phase 8 — ANTLR Migration](phases/phase-8-antlr-migration.md) | Replace hand-rolled parser with ANTLR4-generated parser, existing tests as regression gate | Done |
| [Phase 9 — Variables](phases/phase-9-variables.md) | `let` bindings, mission parameters, per-step `with` clauses, context bag runtime | Done |
| [Phase 10 — Expert Resolution](phases/phase-10-expert-resolution.md) | `use` declarations, directory-per-expert, `mcl init`, lock file, error codes | Done |
| [Phase 11 — OCI Source Support](phases/phase-11-oci-sources.md) | `expert … from/version` grammar, OCI pull into `./experts`, `forge login`; prerequisite library published | Done |
| [Phase 12 — StepEnvelope](phases/phase-12-step-envelope.md) | Structured JSON envelope flowing through pipeline; fail-fast on any step failure; `MissionResult` carries status | Done |
| ~~Phase 13 — passes when~~ | Dropped — failure is declared in the expert MD, not the mission grammar. Bash exit-code model: all steps pass by default; any step returning `fail` stops the mission. | Dropped |
| [Phase 14 — loop N](phases/phase-14-loop.md) | `loop N` on the mission declaration; reserved variables `{{attempt}}` and `{{max_loops}}` injected by runtime | Done |
| [Phase 14.5 — Loop Demo](phases/phase-14.5-loop-demo.md) | `ContextOverloaded` (drunk expert, always self-passes) + `QualityJudge` demo showing loop converging on quality | Done |
| [Phase 15 — Token Streaming](phases/phase-15-streaming.md) | `IAsyncEnumerable<string>` from runner; chunks forwarded to `StepWriter` live; no more silent wait per expert | Done |
| [Phase 16 — FML → MCL Rename](phases/phase-16-fms-rename.md) | Full rename: binary (mcl), extension (.mcl), grammar, generated parser classes, docs. | Done |
| [Phase 17 — Provider Configuration](phases/phase-17-provider-config.md) | Make LLM provider fully configurable via `let` bindings (`provider`, `apiKey`, `model`, `endpoint`). Remove hardcoded OpenAI from CLI. | Done |
| [Phase 18 — Drop MAF](phases/phase-18-drop-maf.md) | Replace `MafExpertRunner` with `DirectExpertRunner` (direct `IChatClient` calls). Remove `Microsoft.Agents.AI` packages. Primary AOT unblocking step. | Done |
| Phase 19 — Agent Runtime Design | Design how an `agent` declaration spawns, manages conversational context/continuity, and surfaces missions behind OpenAI-compatible and native interfaces. Covers: agent grammar, runtime lifecycle, session management, interface adapters. | Design |
| Phase 20 — Parser Project Extraction | Move `ForgeMission.Core/Parser` into a standalone `ForgeMission.Parser` project. Clean compiler/runtime boundary; enables reuse in tooling (language server, IDE plugins). Do after Phase 11 when seams are clear from experience. | Planned |
| Phase 21 — Parallel Steps + Named Outputs | `[A, B, C]` bracket syntax runs experts concurrently; each step's output is stored in the context bag under `{{StepName.output}}` rather than overwriting `{{output}}`. Enables fan-out/fan-in patterns. Motivated by UC-2 (trading signals) and UC-1 (image analysis). | Design |
| Phase 22 — Non-LLM Expert Kinds | `kind` field in expert frontmatter (`llm` default, `onnx`, `http`). Pluggable runner dispatch — ONNX runner reads numeric context keys, writes score back; HTTP runner calls an external scoring endpoint. Context bag gains typed values alongside strings. Motivated by UC-3 (log anomaly detection). | Design |

## Under discussion

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Skills and Tools | Review hub/spoke architecture for expert-level tool-calling support (function calls, MCP tools, shell commands). Decide scope, grammar extension, and AOT-safe dispatch before committing to an implementation phase. |
| Parallel steps runtime model | Decide whether parallel steps use Task.WhenAll (simple) or a channel-based streaming approach (better for token streaming). Consider cancellation on first failure. |
| Context bag typing | Currently all values are strings. Typed values (float, bool, byte[]) needed for non-LLM stages. Decide schema: loose dictionary with type tags vs. strongly-typed envelope. |
