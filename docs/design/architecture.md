# FML — Architecture

## Guiding principle

MAF (Microsoft Agent Framework) is an internal implementation detail. It does not appear above the adapter layer. The parser, AST, pipeline runner, and CLI know nothing about MAF.

## Components

### 1. Parser — `ForgeMission.Core/Parser/`

Pure C#, zero external dependencies. Takes a `.mcl` file as a string, produces an AST.

```
Lexer → TokenStream → Parser → AST
```

**AST nodes:**

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Program` | Root node — list of declarations |
| `MissionDeclaration` | `mission Name = pipeline` |
| `ExpertDeclaration` | `expert Name = pipeline` |
| `Pipeline` | Ordered list of identifiers |
| `Identifier` | PascalCase name |

**Testable in isolation:** unit tests with string inputs only, no disk, no LLM.

---

### 2. Expert Loader — `ForgeMission.Core/Experts/`

Resolves expert names from the AST to markdown files on disk. Parses YAML frontmatter (`name`, `input`, `output`). Validates that every expert referenced in a mission exists before execution begins. Fails fast with a clear error if anything is missing.

**Testable in isolation:** unit tests with fixture markdown files.

---

### 3. Pipeline Runner — `ForgeMission.Core/Runtime/`

Orchestration loop. Walks the pipeline in order, calls `IExpertRunner` for each step, passes the output of step N as input to step N+1, writes each step's output to `runs/<mission-name>/NN-<ExpertName>.md`.

```csharp
interface IExpertRunner
{
    Task<string> RunAsync(ExpertDefinition expert, string context, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

Knows nothing about MAF. Depends only on `IExpertRunner`.

**Testable in isolation:** unit tests with a stub `IExpertRunner` returning canned strings.

---

### 4. MAF Adapter — `ForgeMission.Core/Adapters/MafExpertRunner.cs`

The single place MAF exists in the codebase. Implements `IExpertRunner`. Creates a `ChatClientAgent` with the expert's system prompt, runs it on an `AgentThread` with the incoming context, returns the response as a string.

One file. Swappable without touching anything else.

**Testable:** integration test against a real LLM.

---

### 5. CLI — `ForgeMission.Cli/`

Thin entry point. Parses arguments, wires up dependencies via DI, delegates to Core. No business logic.

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `forge init [mission.mcl]` | Resolve expert sources and generate mcl.lock |
| `forge run [mission.mcl]` | Run a mission (self-contained — no input file required) |
| `forge validate [mission.mcl]` | Validate all experts exist and pipeline is well-formed |
| `forge list experts` | List available experts |
| `forge expert init <Name>` | Scaffold a new expert directory |

---

## Dependency flow

```
CLI
 └→ Pipeline Runner
      └→ Parser           (produces AST)
      └→ Expert Loader    (resolves markdown)
      └→ IExpertRunner
           └→ MAF Adapter (hidden — only impl of IExpertRunner)
```

Strictly one direction. Nothing flows upward.

## Project references

```
ForgeMission.Cli
  └→ ForgeMission.Core

ForgeMission.Core
  └→ Microsoft.Agents.*   (MAF — adapter only)
```

## Output structure

```
runs/
  <mission-name>/
    01-<ExpertName>.md
    02-<ExpertName>.md
    ...
    final.md
```

Each step output is written before the next step begins, so a partial run is always inspectable.
